        "After training a single DeBERTa-Large baseline model for 7 epochs,resulting in 0.870 score on leaderboard, we extend the setup by training three separate models with different random seeds (42, 2025, 123) to improve stability and generalization. The training uses a long sequence length (MAX_LEN = 512), gradient accumulation for an effective larger batch size, and a 7-epoch schedule with a cosine LR scheduler. To better handle class imbalance, we replace the default BCE loss with Focal Loss (α = 0.25, γ = 2.0) through a custom Trainer. Each model is trained using the same hyperparameters and tokenization settings, and the best results per epoch are logged via Weights & Biases. After training, we compute optimal per-label thresholds using validation predictions, and then create an ensemble by averaging model probabilities across all seeds. Finally, the ensemble is used to generate test predictions, apply tuned thresholds, and create the final submission CSV along with saved thresholds for reproducibility."

        "**This function searches for the best decision threshold for each emotion label by testing values from 0.20 to 0.75 and selecting the one that produces the highest F1 score on validation data. Instead of using a fixed 0.5 cutoff, it computes label-specific thresholds to better match each class's distribution. This improves multi-label performance because different emotions have different score ranges, and optimized thresholds significantly boost overall F1 and recall.**"
